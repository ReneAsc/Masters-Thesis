## Master's Thesis Project

Welcome to my master's thesis project. I wrote this thesis to obtain my master's degree in mathematics.  

The main intention of this work is to dive into the fact that under certain conditions the harmonic measure and the maximal-entropy measure of a Julia set are equal if and only if we are talking about a polynomial.

The result has several precedents but I studied mainly a paper by Okuyama & Stawiska (see the thesis for further details).


The thesis may contain typos that I will be fixing and commiting those changes here. I'll be tagging the initial commit to track the state of the thesis as it was published at CIMAT.
